    in JSON format.\n3. JSON must include response_type, tts_text, and argument.\n4.
    response_type must be \"success\" or \"dialogue\".\n5. \"success\" is used when
    the user mentions both the sound and its correct direction; incorrect answers
    return \"dialogue\".\n6. argument has three possible values:\n  - 0 \u2192 User
    gave an answer related to the owl\n  - 1 \u2192 User gave an answer related to
    the bird\n  - 2 \u2192 User gave an answer related to the bell\r\n\r\n\U0001F539
    Explanation\r\n1. User is the player, and Answer is the tts_text that GPT responds
    with.\r\n2. tts_text is a sentence dynamically generated based on the user\u2019s
    spoken input.\r\n3. The first sound is the owl, the second is the bird, and the
    last sound is the bell\r\n\r\nListen carefully and match both the direction and
